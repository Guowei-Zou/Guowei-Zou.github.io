title: "65‐1: Deep Learning‐Enabled Image Content Adaptive Driving Algorithm for Field Sequential Color LCDs with Mini‐LED Backlight"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-06-28-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We propose a driving algorithm for field sequential color (FSC) LCDs with a mini‐LED backlight. The algorithm adapts to image content through deep learning‐based image classification performed in each image segment, ensuring minimized color breakup in all segments. The mini‐LED FSC‐LCD having low color breakup for arbitrary images well satisfies applications needing high resolution and low power consumption.'
