excerpt: 'We propose a driving method for field sequential color displays, which simultaneously considers color breakup (CBU and flicker using multi-objective optimization. We achieve the Pareto optimality. The CBU-priority and flicker-priority solutions, respectively, surpass all reference methods in CBU and flicker suppression. The balanced solution simultaneously suppresses CBU and flicker better than the reference methods.'
