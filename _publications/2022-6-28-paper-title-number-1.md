title: "42‐2: Spatial resolution‐tripled integral imaging light field displays with no loss of angular resolution by recombining subpixels with zero sampling error"

excerpt: 'We previously proposed to recombine subpixels across elemental images to triple the spatial resolution of integral imaging light field displays; however, the sampling errors of subpixels force us to waive a portion of subpixels, resulting in a reduced angular resolution. In this study, the sampling errors of all subpixels are demonstrated to be zero under a specific system configuration; thus, no angular resolution is lost with a tripled spatial resolution.'
